An English translation of the task given


Task 5.3. Create Console Application – Digit Average
Command 1. Write a program that will load a number and calculate the geometric mean of the digits. You must force the loaded number to be at least three-digit. Please make sure that the loaded string is a number.


Task 5.5. Create a console application – local minima and maxima
Command 1. Write a program that will load a sequence of integers {ai}, i=1, 2, …, n. Make sure that ai ! = ai+1 when loading data. Find and display the number of local minima and maxima in this sequence, moving in steps of 1.
Example:
a= {1, 2, 0, 3, 8, 7}
1. (1, 2, 0) -> max = 1, min = 0
2. (2, 0, 3) -> max = 1, min = 1
3. (0, 3, 8) -> max = 1, min = 1, because the sequence is increasing
4. (3, 8, 7) -> max = 2, min = 1
